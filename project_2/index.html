        <p>
            Ailey.org is website for the "The Alvin Ailey American Dance Company" and the "Ailey School". The purpose of the website is to show case up coming performances, 
            inform people of their mission statement, and to promote their various dance education programs. 
            The Ailey company has recently redesign their website and logo. 
            They've shorten their name to Ailey rather than the Alvin Ailey dance company and have a much sleeker, modern design. 
            Ailey has made a notable reputation for themselves, being the First African American Dance Company and focus on staying true to the principals that Alvin Ailey founded for the Organization. 
            It is important to the website that the Ailey looks professional and involved in the community, so that people are eager to get involved, whether that means becoming donors or taking classes.

  <p>	The opening visuals for the Ailey website are eye catching displays of work done my the Ailey company along with dates of performances and a link to by tickets. This website succeeds in showing us what the company has to offer and where we can go to find. As you scroll down the website shows us clips of the Ailey company being involved in their community and  brief summary of the company's goals. The further you scroll it gives summaries of each training program they offer. At the bottom the websites invites you to become part of their foundation and shows ways to join. The website uses a modern and easy to read san serif font continuously throughout the pages. One Feature that stood out to me was the color of the webpage changing, as you scroll down the page goes from black to white back to black. They also have the different programs color coded, which is visually appeal and a helpful guide. The website also works well on mobile devices. One big different that stood out to me was that on the phone you are about to jump to different sections. I found that to be a good adjustment because when the homepage is displayed on the phone is creates a much longer webpage. </p>

<p>		There is a lot information that the Ailey company has to share and as a result the webpage can easily become over whelming. This single website has information on the Ailey company, Ailey II, Ailey community, The Ailey school (and its different programs), Ailey extension, the Ailey exhibit, and donations. This information is not too difficult to find given that the website has too menus. However, it can be challenging to know where to look because there are so many options. I'm curious as to why they have two menu options. They both provide the came information, but one is more visually appealing. when i took a further look I discovered that the more of a submenu that where someone might go if they are look to take classes, the main menu also has this information but the other menu make it easier to find.

        Most of the interactives on the website can be found when looking at the menus, this make it easy to navigate because it highlights different sections. The videos that play through the page make it fun to scroll. Incorporating videos of dancing for a dance website is really important and helps to build the personality of the dance company.

    <p>
        The Ailey website has successfully displays the missions and objectives of the Ailey organization. However, with the rebranding of Ailey, I worried that they have lost much of Ailey's characteristic and charms. This website doesn't have any personality beside from the images and clips of the Ailey company that have been added. It would be interesting to see them build character through elements the website design. They do this with the animation of the logo and the one of the menus, but i would like to see more throughout the website. If you look back at older posters and adversitements for the company,then you'll see they have distincted charactersistics and  themes that relate to the company. Given that Ailey has great historical value, it would be nice to seem them take inspirtation from the art style of older posters.   I would also like a better way of organization from the information on the website. There are many different programs for one website and that can make navigation confusing. They need to be minimal and direct with there menus to prevent confusion.
