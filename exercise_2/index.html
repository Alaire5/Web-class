      <h1>10 Principles for good Design</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
        <h3>Innovative</h3>
    
            
            <img src="3d_printer.jpg" alt="3d printer" width="300px">
            <p> New technolgoy gives us the ability to create new design. 3-D printers introduces a new way to cutomize deigns and creatve protoypes.</p>
        <h3>Useful</h3>
            <img src="3d_printer.jpg" alt="garlic press" width="300px">
            <p> Design products that look good and are functional</p>
            
        <h3>Aesthetic</h3>
            <img src="asthectic.jpg" alt="couch that looks like shrimp" width="300px">   
        <p> Making the products we use in our day to day lives look visually pleasing. Most people have a need for a couch and are able to use on they find comfortable and stylish. </p>
            
        <h3>Understandable</h3>
            <img src="understandable.jpg" alt="stairs" width="300px">
            <p> The design of a product should make it obvious how it is used. It is universally known that stairs can take you up and down. </p>
            
        <h3>Unobtrusive</h3>
            <img src="unobtrustive.jpg" alt="picture frames" width="300px">
            <p>Products are tools that allow the consumer to keep their self-expression. Picture Frames come in many unique designs that allow us to show case photos and painting that we choose. </p>
            
        <h3>Honest</h3>
            <img src="honest.jpg" alt="graphing calculator" width="300px">
            <p> A product does no try to be more than what it is. Graphing caluators used to just graph, these days you are able to load games and color on them. That's example of a product doing too much.  </p>
           

        <h3>Long-Lasting</h3>
        <img src="jorts.jpg" alt="jorts" width="300px">
            <p>A timeless design that outlast treads. Jorts and denim have been wore for hundreds of years and people will continue to wear them. </p>
        

        <h3> thorough and detail</h3>
        <img src="watch.jpg" alt="unusal watch" width="300px">
            <p>caring for the design of a product shows respect towards the consumer.
                The deisgn of this watch is not just for fun, the creator was nitention about were they chose to place the each part of the design so that the watch is still functionable.  </p>
            
        
        <h3>Environmentally-Freindly</h3>
        <img src="orange peel.jpg" alt="orange peel" width="300px">
            <p> deisign should conserve its resources and preserve the enviorment. Oranges come in natural casing and do not need added packaging.</p>
            
        
            <h3>Less is Better</h3>
            <img src="more.jpg" alt="ugly christmas sweater" width="300px">
            <p> concentrate on the essence of the design and what is needed. Ugly Christmas sweaters add way too many elements, hence why they are called ugly. </p>
