    <h1> What is a Website</h1>
</header>
    <br>

   
    <p>A website allows creators to be a part of a vast network in which they can archive their work in personalized spaces. When you have a website, you display the content you create in the world you created. 
        As Schwulst stated, “World-building means creating everything—not only making things inside the world, but also the surrounding world itself—the language, style, rules, and architecture”(68). 
        This concept is your creative freedom when you have a website. There are many possibilities of what your website can be. 
        A website provides infinite space to organize, sculpt, and cultivate your content. There is flexibility within a website to update content as you choose or to leave it as is. A website will stay as long as you want, and you have space to present content that might not hold as long in a store or gallery. 
        Since a website is part of a network, your content can reach a large audience and connect to more information. A Website is your gallery you can arrange and showcase your content and display to the world. </p>
